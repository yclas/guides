You already started your classified website, but then people started giving you advice on sitemaps, like submitting a sitemap to search engines? That's possible with Yclas! Read on.

So what’s a sitemap?
 Well, basically a site map is a document that shows all pages on your website and how they’re linked together, according to  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map) the definition is:

_“A site map (or sitemap) is a list of pages of a web site accessible to crawlers or users. It can be either a document in any form used as a planning tool for Web design, or a Web page that lists the pages on a Web site, typically organized in hierarchical fashion.”_

Yclas generates your sitemap automatically, so it’s very easy to submit it to google, bing or any other search engine webmaster tools and here is how to find your sitemap:

### In the case that you have less than 10k ads

To submit it to a search engine simply go to your file manager and to the folder where Yclas is installed then download the file and submit it.

### In the case that you have more than 10k ads
