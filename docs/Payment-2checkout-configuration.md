# 2checkout Configuration


First, you need to create an account on  [2checkout](https://www.2checkout.com/). You have to enter your personal/business details to activate your account, then go to your dashboard and click  **Account**  ->  **Site Management**.

From there you have to follow the instructions:

-   Select the  **Pricing Currency**  you want to use.
-   Select  **Refund Policy**  and  **Privacy Policy**.
-   Choose  **Header Redirect (Your URL)**
-   Enter http://yourdomain.com/twocheckout/pay/null/ in  **Approved URL**  field.

Login to your website as admin, go to  **Settings**  ->  **Payment**,  **2checkout**  and fill  **Account Number**  and  **Secret Word**  fields. You can find these values in your 2checkout dashboard (see the image below).
