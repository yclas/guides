# Allowed email domains


This feature gives you the option to allow the registration of users that use a **specific domain** for their email address. 
For example, you can allow the registration of students using their university email address or users using an email address of an organization or company.

To enable this feature you need to go to  **Settings**  ->  **General**  and there you need to write your email domains. 
*Keep in mind that you need to push enter after each email domain name so that it's saved.

If you want to allow **all the email domains** to be able to register on your site, just leave the field empty.
