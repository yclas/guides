## Browse ads by distance

This feature allows your users to search for products based on their distance! When using your website, users can browse the ads that are short by distance, and see how far the items are from them.

For example, your users can browse through  **items near me** , **items in a distance of 30 kilometers** or even **items in short distance** thanks to this feature.
