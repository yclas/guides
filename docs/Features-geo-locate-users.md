# Geo lolcate users

This feature allows you locate your users geographical location by means of their displayed digital information. 
When enable option is enabled the visitor’s browser will ask them if they want to share their location. If they consent, their browser estimates their location and shares it with your website. 
Users' location can be used in the listing page, if user consent to share their location it shows results based on it.
