## Shipping

This feature allows users to specify the shipping cost for their products.

If you don’t know how, you can follow  [this guide](Custom-fields-create-custom-fields.md).

***Remember:** The **new custom field** MUST be titled **"shipping"** and the **LABEL** must be **'Shipping'** as well. 
*Follow this example:*
**NAME:**   shipping
**LABEL:**    Shipping
**TOOLTIP:**    Shipping price

After you create the field, when a seller posts his advertisement he will be able set the price for shipping by filling this field. 

Then on the checkout page, the shipping cost will be displayed after the item price. 

Finally, the order will be the **shipping cost** plus the item price.

*Remember, it’s very important to name this field  **“shipping”**!*

## Pick up

Now users can choose if their product is available for shipping, pick up or both. 

1. What you need to do is to create a custom checkbox field called  **shipping_pickup**,  

*If you don’t know how, you can follow  [this guide](Custom-fields-create-custom-fields.md).*

 This field will add an option in the “Publish new” form, titled 'Shipping Pickup'

2. If the option for pick up is **checked,** users will be able to choose the shipping method in the checkout page.
