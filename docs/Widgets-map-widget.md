# Why is my map widget not showing anything?

*This is a common question lately.*
So you got your website started, you created some ads and then you went to  **Panel**  >  **Appearance**  >  **Widgets**  and added a map widget.

If you’re not sure, what I am talking about, check the screenshot below.

Then you went to your website and you see this:

This happens when you don’t have any real addresses on your ads. By a real address I mean an address that can be recognized by Google Maps. Now, try adding an address recognized by Google Maps, for example  _Barcelona, Spain_.

If you have multiple addresses, the map widget would automatically zoom out to show all of your ads addresses, just as I did here:
