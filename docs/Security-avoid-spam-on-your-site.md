Spam is a serious issue, that’s why at Yclas we have developed a set of tools to help/prevent getting these ads and making your site look unprofessional.

### Moderate Ads

The best option is to moderate the ads. With this, you make sure you don’t get spam or duplicated ads.

Go to the control panel and navigate to  **Configuration** -> **Settings > General**  > Opens your general site's settings. Set the Moderation option on **“Moderation On”**
