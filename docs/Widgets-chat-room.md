# How to add a chat room to my classifieds website?

You have a limited-user classifieds website or a even a larger website? The chat widget is a powerful tool that would enhance your users' experience. *A couple of releases ago we added a chat widget to the list of widgets you could choose from.*

**To add a chat box to your website you need to follow the next steps:**

1.  Log in to your  **Admin Panel**
2.  Go to  **Appearance**  >  **Widgets**
3.  Select  **Chat**  and press  **Create**

4.  **Input your settings**  (here you have to make sure that you input a ***name*** for your chat room that is unique and ***not used*** before, otherwise you will get an empty box) and select  **Save Changes**


**After following the steps you can visit your website and see the chat room functioning.*

**Some extras you can know about the chat widget:**

1.  If you log in with Twitter your avatar would show on chat.
2.  If you paste a link to an image, it will show the image inline. Also, pasted URLs will turn into links.
3.  There is some (limited) Markdown support: __bold__, _italic_, `code`, > blockquote, * list, — hr,  strike, and alt.
