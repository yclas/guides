# How to change Time Zone 🌐


It’s important to have your Time Zone correctly set up. For example, ads, orders, reviews, topics and replies on forum, blog posts etc, will not display the date or time you expect to if you don’t have the correct timezone set in your website.

To change the Time Zone, follow these steps:

1.  Go to Panel,  **Settings**  ->  **General**
2.  In the  _Regional Settings_  section,  **Time Zone**  field, select your city or the city with the same timezone as yours.
3.  Press  **Save**
