You got your classified ads website ready to work and you’re thinking about the next step? How can you compete with others who might already have their websites triving in your targeted niche? Let's look at the best ways to promote your classified site with focus on non-conventional techniques rather than on paid advertising:

### Word of mouth & social media marketing

Spreading word of mouth strategies changed a lot since the existence of social media. Now, you have a lot of powerful tools to get your site right at your targeted users screens. Though there are some rules you might want to consider when developing your strategy in spreading the word on your website:

-   Make sure you know where your users are. Is Facebook their popular social media platform? Or are they active on Twitter?
-   Make it easy for them to spread the word; add social media like buttons or integrate a social log in into your classifieds website (this is available in our  [premium themes](Themes-configuration-of-premuim-themes.md)
-   Give them a reason to share! Of course, “free” is the most popular word among classifieds websites, but that is not enough to convince users to share your website. Adding useful content or having something unique on your website will give them motive to share it.
-   Track referrals, keep checking who is referring to your website and try to find who has the most impact in increasing traffic, then make use of that information.

### Media exposure

Every business can spend some money and place an ad on TV or in the local newspaper. But, you can advertise without spending a dime! 
Ask around,  your family,friends and people you know. There could be a guy who knows a guy at the local TV station, don’t hesitate to ask for help!  A simple mention of your website on TV in the morning show will have a significant effect on the website traffic.

### Interacting with potential returning users

Depending on your targeted niche, there are certain people who could prove useful to know and get in contact with personally! Once, I read  about a guy who went door to door to many business owners, told them about his website and posted ads himself until he got his classifieds website popular. Hard work always pays off!

### Give a personal touch and exist on many platforms

Research where potential users might be spending time and create a profile there. It takes time and effort but it will improve your traffic.
 Be active on forums in your niche market. By “active”, I don’t mean pasting links of your website, I mean posting useful comments or giving advice. Also, giving a personal touch to your posts would show users that there is a person behind the platform they are using. This would increase their trust in the website just by readin a single post.
