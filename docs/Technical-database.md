# Yclas database description

In the past, we worked on helping  **developers**  and  **advanced users**  to understand more on how the information is distributed in Yclas database and to give a better overall understanding of how Yclas works.

Basically, this is a detailed description of the database tables created during the installation of Yclas. Currently, the database supported by Yclas is MySQL version 5.0 or greater.
